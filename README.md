# Greenhouse_Monitoring_and_Controlling_System
Have you ever found yourself contemplating the well-being of your beloved plants when you're away for the weekend or on business trips? Relying on your neighbors to care for them might not be the ideal solution. How about the concept of automating this responsibility? Introducing the "Smart Greenhouse" â€“ a cutting-edge solution designed to address precisely that.

# Requirements
To set up this project, you will require:

An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) - The preferred choice is the Arduino IDE, as it provides a user-friendly platform for code compilation and execution.

Hardware components, including:

Soil moisture sensor
DHT temperature and humidity sensor
Microcontroller boards like NODEMCU
LCD screen for displaying information
Relay boards for controlling the greenhouse's lighting and water pump
Actuators such as a cooling fan, water pump, and LED lights, enabling you to take the necessary actions to regulate and optimize plant growth.

# Deployment
To set up and deploy this project:

1. Begin by establishing the circuit connections.

2. Next, compile both the receiving code and sensor code in your chosen IDE, ensuring that you have selected the correct board and port settings.

3. To create and manage the variables used in the project, you will need an Ubidots account. STEM UBIDOTS is highly recommended for hosting personal projects, making it an excellent choice for students looking to experiment with their IoT projects.
